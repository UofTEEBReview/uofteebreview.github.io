title: Introducing <i>The EEB Quarterly</i>
---

The EEB Quarterly is a digital publication in the style of a general-interest magazine made by
and for graduate students in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the
University of Toronto. The Quarterly consists of a Newsletter and a Features portion. Our
mission is two-fold:

1. The Newsletter highlights recent work by EEB graduate students and gathers useful
information from the three campuses in one place. This includes news like thesis defences,
publications, upcoming workshops and lecture series, reminders for conference deadlines and
funding, activities available to us on and around the three campuses, as well as short student
interviews on matters of general interest. Our aim is to identify and highlight the news and
information most relevant to us, the students of EEB, and to celebrate the achievements and
personalities of our department members.
2. The Features section allows graduate students to publicly express their original ideas on
tropics related to EEB and the scientific community in the form of essays and reviews; its
purpose is to provide an outlet for students to practice non-technical science writing and build
their portfolios. Think of this as a friendly environment in which to sharpen your writing skills. If
you like to think and write about science or nature, writing for the EEB Quarterly gives you
built-in access to an interested audience and the opportunity for both feedback and a line on your
CV.

Throughout both sections, we highlight artwork and photography by EEB graduate students.

## __Affiliation__

We currently have no formal affiliation with the EEB department or with the Ecology and
evolution Graduate Students Association (EGSA), though this may change in the future. We
want all students to feel represented by the Quarterly, but we don’t claim to represent the EEB
student body in any technical manner.

## __How it works: volunteer editors and writers__

The Newsletter portion is the responsibility of the volunteer editors. Toward the beginning of
each quarter, the editors meet to pitch newsletter segments, decide on which segments to run, and
make segment assignments.

For the features portion, essays and book reviews are submitted by student writers. We solicit
essay commitments at the end of each publication month (September, December, March, June)
by email. Interested students are encouraged to respond promptly to secure an essay slot. Each
piece is due at the beginning of the publication month (i.e. 1 st of September for the Fall issue).
After this, our aim is to have a one-week turnaround on edits. Unlike with scientific manuscripts,
essay writers will not necessarily have to submit revisions; small-scale revisions will be made by
editors unless authors request to make their own. For larger-scale changes, authors will be
contacted by the editor with recommendations. See the Get Involved page for more details on
essay categories.

Calls for photography and art submissions are made approximately one month before publication
date, but we will accept submissions at any time throughout the year.
Unfortunately, we are unable to pay for submitted writing, photography, artwork, or editing. All
participation is currently voluntary.

## __Who can submit writing and art/photography to the Quarterly?__
All graduate students in EEB at UofT are eligible to submit writing, art, and photography.

## __GET INVOLVED!__
The EEB Quarterly is intended to be a useful, amusing, and thought-provoking resource for
readers and writers. It is also meant to be available to all students in the department, not a small
handful. So join up! Participation in the review benefits the departmental community, your
writing and CV, and ultimately benefits your career. We hope to hear from you!
